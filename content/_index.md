  #           My research employs computational social science methods, utilizing machine-learning algorithms to create large-scale datasets from diverse image and text data sources. These datasets are pivotal in addressing substantive questions within his field. His substantive areas include the interrelated dynamics of protests and surveillance.

  #           My first major project involved constructing a dataset of protest events in contemporary China (post-2010). This dataset facilitated a comprehensive analysis of trends, causes, effects and media biases associated with protests. The findings from this project have contributed to a deeper understanding of social dynamics in a controlled media environment.

  #           The second major project he led developed a global-scale dataset detailing surveillance camera density across more than 1,000 cities and 100 countries. His current research explores how this increasing surveillance capability enables states to preemptively curb protests, potentially altering the foundational dynamics of social movements.

  #           Additionally, he has been recognized for his innovative work in developing methodologies for the analysis of large-scale image datasets in social science research.
