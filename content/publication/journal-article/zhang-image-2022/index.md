*Abstract*: Automated image analysis has received increasing attention in social scientific
  research, yet existing scholarship has focused on the application of supervised
  machine learning to classify images into predefined categories. This study focuses
  on the task of unsupervised image clustering, which automatically finds categories
  from image data. First, we review the steps to perform image clustering, and then
  we focus on the key challenge of performing unsupervised image clustering---finding
  low-dimensional representations of images. We present several methods of extracting
  low-dimensional representations of images, including the traditional bag-of-visual-words
  model, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning. We compare these methods
  using two datasets containing images related to protests in China (from Sina Weibo,
  Chinese Twitter) and to climate change(from Instagram). Results show that transfer
  learning significantly outperforms other methods. The dataset used in the pretrained
  model critically determines what categories algorithms can discover.
