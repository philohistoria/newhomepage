I am an Assistant professor of [Sociology](https://www.brown.edu/academics/sociology/people/faculty) and [International and Public affairs](https://home.watson.brown.edu/people/faculty/watson-faculty/han-zhang) at Brown University.
Before Brown, I worked as an Assistant Professor in [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.ust.hk/), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
I obtained my Ph.D. in Sociology at Princeton University in 2020, under the supervision of [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/). I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in History, 2013, from Peking University.

I will join Brown University as Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.brown.edu/academics/sociology/) and [International and Public Affairs](https://home.watson.brown.edu/) from July 2024.


My research spans computational social science, social movements, social networks, and quantitative methods. 

- My recent substantive projects include:

  - Protests (particularily in China); their causes and consequences.

  - Global surveillance and its social impact

- My recent methodological projects include:

  - Image as data
  - Robust use of machine learning algorithms in social science research
  - LLM and survey data

  <!--My dissertation identifies, describes and explains political protests in China using social media data. Datasets about protest events in authoritarian have been scant. In the first chapter of my dissertation, I use the state-of-art deep learning methods with both image and text data to identify 136,330 offline collective action events in China from 2011 - 2017 from 9.5 Million Weibo (Chinese Twitter) posts. With this unique dataset, the second chapter of my dissertation characterizes the prevalence, trends, geographical distribution, issues, tactics of the protests in China and their interaction with the police.-->
